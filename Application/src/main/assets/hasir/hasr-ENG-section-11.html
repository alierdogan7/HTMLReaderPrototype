				<p class="Paragraf-1 Haşiye" name="prg-627">There are two varieties of justice, one <span class="Kırmızı">affirmative</span>, the other negative. The positive variety consists in giving the deserving his right. This form of justice exists throughout the world in the most obvious fashion, because, as proven in the Third Truth, it observably bestows, in accordance with special balances and particular criteria, all the objects of desire requested by everything from its Glorious Creator with the tongue of innate capacity, the language of natural need, <span class="Mavi">the speech of necessity,</span> and all the requirements of life and existence. This variety of justice is, then, as certain as life and existence itself. The other variety of justice, the negative, consists in <span class="Yatık">chastising</span> the unjust; it gives wrongdoers their due by way of requittal and punishment. This type of justice is not fully manifest in this world, even though there are countless signs and indications that permit us to sense its true nature. For example, all the chastising blows and punitive lashes that have descended on all <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">rebellious</span> peoples, from the Ad and Thamud to those of the present age, show definitely that an exalted justice dominates the world.</p>
