Every invocation of peace and blessings upon him by every member of the Muslim community in the course of his prayer, as well as the prayer for him uttered after the second call to prayer according to the Shafi’i school - this too is a powerful and universal amen to his supplication for eternal bliss. So the eternity and everlasting bliss desired by all men with all of their strength, in accordance with their primordial disposition, is requested in the name of <span class="Kırmızı">humanity</span> by the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the luminous segment of humanity says “amen” after him.

				<p class="Paragraf-1 Haşiye" name="prg-431"> Indeed, it is not at all possible that the <span class="Kırmızı">Master</span> of this world, all of Whose doings are self-evidently inspired by consciousness, knowledge and wisdom, should be unaware and uninformed of the acts of the foremost among all of His creatures.  Again, it is not at all possible that the All-Knowing Master should <span class="Mavi">remain indifferent </span>to the deeds and prayers of that foremost among His creatures, and deem them unimportant despite being aware of them.  It is further impossible that the Powerful and Merciful Master of the World should not accept his prayers, having not remained indifferent to them. Yes, through the light of the Muhammedan Being the form of the world has changed.  The <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">true essence</span> of men and all beings in the cosmos became apparent through that light; it became clear that they are each missives of the Eternally Besought One proclaiming the Divine Names, precious and profound beings with God-given functions and destined to manifest eternity.  Were it not for that light, beings would be condemned to <span class="Kırmızı">utter annihilation</span>, they would be valueless, meaningless, useless, confused, the result of blind chance, sunk in the <span class="Mavi">darkness of illusion</span>. It is for this reason that just as men say “amen” to the prayer of the Prophet, so too all other beings, from the face of the earth up to God’s throne, from the soil to the stars, all take pride in his light, and proclaim their connection with him.  The very spirit of the worship of the Prophet is indeed none other than this prayer.  Again, all the motions and workings of the cosmos are in their essence prayer.  For example, the progress of a seed until it becomes a tree is <span class="Yatık">a form of </span>prayer to the Creator. </p>
