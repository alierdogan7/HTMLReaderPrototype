There is, therefore, an <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">inverse relationship</span> between sustenance on the one hand and strength and will power on the other.

Again, the fact that even unconscious plants and <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">beasts</span> function in the wisest and most conscious of fashions demostrates irrefutably that One Utterly Knowing and All- Wise has set them to work, and that they are acting in His name.</p>

				<p class="Paragraf-1 Haşiye" name="prg-352"> The sentence “is it at all possible?” is indeed repeated many times, because it expresses a most significant mystery.

Now in this discussion of resurrection it has been decisively demonstrated that true impossiblity, absurdity and <span class="Kırmızı">irrationality</span> pertain to the path of misbelief and the road of misguidance, whereas true possibility, facility and rationality are characteristics of the path of faith and highway of Islam. In short, the philosophers tend to unbelief on account of their regarding things as impossible, whereas the Tenth Word (discussion of resurrection), by means of the repeated sentence, “is it at all possible?” shows where impossibility lies, and thus <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">deals</span> them <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">a blow </span>in the mouth.</p>
