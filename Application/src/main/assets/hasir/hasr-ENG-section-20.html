                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1045"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and it is,thus making of them <br>manifestations of “resurrection <br>after death,” and that </span><span class="Koyu">resurrects</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> <br>three hundred thousand different <br>species of the various groups of <br>plant and nations of animals, as <br>hundreds of thousands of </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">specimens</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> <br>of the supreme resurrection.</span></p>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1046"><span xml:lang="en-GB">The existence of the hereafter is <br>also necessitated by an Eternal <br>Mercy and Permanent Grace <br>that sustains in </span><span class="Kırmızı">wondrous</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> and <br>solicitous fashion all animate <br>beings that stand in need of <br>nurture, and that display each <br>spring, in the briefest of periods, <br>infinite different varieties of <br></span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">adornment</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> and beauty.</span></p>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1047"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Finally, there is the self-evident <br>proof and indication given by the <br>intense, </span><span class="Yatık" xml:lang="en-GB">unshakeable</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">, and permanent <br></span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">love of </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">eternity</span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">, </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">yearning for immortality <br>and hope of permanence that are lodged <br>in man, the most beloved creation of <br>the Maker of the cosmos, and whose <br></span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">concern</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">with</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> all the beings in the <br>cosmos is the greatest.</span></p>
                <hr class="sayfaAralik"><a class="pageNumber" name="page-202">#202</a>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1048"><span xml:lang="en-GB">All of the foregoing so firmly </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">prove</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> <br>that after this transient world there <br>will be an eternal world, a hereafter, <br>a realm of felicity, that we are <br>compelled to accept the existence <br>of a hereafter as indisputably as <br>we accept the existence of this world.</span></p>
                <p class="Paragraf-1 Haşiye" name="prg-1049">It can be realized from this comparison how easy it is to make a positive affirmation and how <span class="Kırmızı">difficult</span> to make a denial and negation. If, for example, someone should say, “there exists somewhere on this earth a wondrous garden containing canned milk,” and someone else should say, “there is not,” the affirmer need only point to the place of that garden or show some of its fruits in order to prove his claim. The <span class="Mavi">denier,</span> by contrast, will have to inspect and display the whole world in order to justify his negation. So too the testimony of two <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">veracious witnesses</span> will be enough to establish the existence of Paradise, quite apart from the hundreds of thousands of traces, fruits and indications demonstrated by those who assert its existence. Those who deny it must examine, explore and sift the infinite cosmos and infinite time before they can prove their denial and demonstrate the non-existence of Paradise. So, o aged brothers of mine, understand how firm is belief in the hereafter.</p>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1050"><span xml:lang="en-GB">One of the most important lessons <br>taught us by the </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">All-Wise Qur’an, </span><span xml:lang="en-GB"><br>is, then, belief in the hereafter.</span></p>
                <hr class="sayfaAralik"><a class="pageNumber" name="page-203">#203</a>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1051"><span xml:lang="en-GB"><br>This belief is so firm and contains within itself <br>so powerful a hope and a </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">consolation</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> that <br>if a person be assailed by old age hundred <br>thousandfold, the consolation derived from <br>this belief will be fully </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">enough.</span></p>
                <p class="Paragraf-1" name="prg-1052"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Saying,”</span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">Praise be to God</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> for the perfection of belief,” we old people should rejoice in old age</span></p>
