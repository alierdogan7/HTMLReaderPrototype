			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">First the </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">empty-headed man</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> said: </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">The </span><span class="CharOverride-5" xml:lang="en-GB">oppressor</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> retains his power, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and </span><span class="Yatık" xml:lang="en-GB">ordering</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> affairs are managed, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and with what true justice </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">balance</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4" xml:lang="en-GB">transactions</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> are effected! </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Now a wise polity requires that those who seek refuge under the </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">protecti</span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">ng wing</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> of the state should receive favour, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">But here in this land, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">not a thousandth part of the requirements of such wisdom and justice is </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">fulfill</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">ed; </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">for example, </span></p>

			<p class="Alt-Başlık"><span class="CharOverride-9">Fourth Aspect</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Look at these innumerable and peerless jewels that are </span>displayed<span xml:lang="en-GB"> here, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">For just as the </span><span class="Koyu">cessation of pain</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> is pleasurable, so too is the cessation of pleasure painful! </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Look at these displays </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and the announcements concerning them! </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">And listen to these </span><span class="CharOverride-4" xml:lang="en-GB">heralds</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span>proclaiming<span xml:lang="en-GB"> the fine and delicate arts of a </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">miracle-working</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> monarch, and demonstrating his perfections! </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">They are declaring his </span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">peerless</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">who will gaze on it exclaiming, Ma’shallah!, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">thus displaying it and making it known.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">As for </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">concealed</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> and peerless beauty, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">it too requires to see and be seen, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">or rather to behold itself in two ways.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">The first consists of contemplating itself </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">in different mirrors, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and the second of contemplating itself </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">by means of the contemplation of enraptured spectators and </span><span class="Kırmızı">astounded</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">admirers</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Hidden beauty wishes, then, to see and be seen, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">For eternal beauty </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2 ParaOverride-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">can never be content with a transient admirer; </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">moreover, an admirer </span><span class="CharOverride-5" xml:lang="en-GB">destined to perish</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">without hope of return </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">It is in man’s nature to hate </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">what he does not know and </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">cannot obtain.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Now everyone leaves the </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">hospice</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> of this realm very quickly and vanishes, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">having seen </span>only a light<span xml:lang="en-GB"> or </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Hence, it is necessary that he should go towards an eternal </span><span class="Koyu">realm where he will contemplate the Divine beauty and perfection.</span></p>
			<p class="Alt-Başlık"><span class="CharOverride-9">Fifth Aspect</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">See, it is evident from all these matters that </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">that peerless Being </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">is possessed of most great mercy.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">For he causes </span><span class="CharOverride-5" xml:lang="en-GB">aid</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> to be swiftly </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Come now, let us go; </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">there is a great meeting on that island.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">All the </span><span class="CharOverride-5" xml:lang="en-GB">nobles</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> of the land are assembled there.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">See, a most noble commander, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">bearing exalted decorations, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">is pronouncing a </span><span class="Mavi">discourse</span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">, </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">and requesting </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">certain things from that </span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">compassionate</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> monarch.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">All those present say: “Yes, we too desire the same,” and affirm and </span><span class="CharOverride-5" xml:lang="en-GB">assent</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> to his words.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Now listen to the words of that commander favoured by his monarch:</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">“O monarch that </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">nurtures us with his bounty!</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">You also hear him supplicating. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Is it at all possible that </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">so merciful and powerful a monarch, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">in the hospice of the world.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Having </span>spent<span xml:lang="en-GB"> so much effort on these </span><span class="Koyu">places of witnessing</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> that will last only five or six days, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and on the foundation of this kingdom, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">in order to demonstrate instances of his power, he will, without doubt, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">palaces of bliss or </span><span class="Mavi">dungeons</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> await them.</span></p>
			<p class="Alt-Başlık"><span class="CharOverride-9">Sixth Aspect</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Come now, look! </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">All these imposing railways, planes, </span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">machines</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">, </span>warehouses<span xml:lang="en-GB">, exhibitions show that </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Such a monarch requires subjects </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span class="CharOverride-4" xml:lang="en-GB">worthy</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> of himself.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">But now you see all his </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">subjects</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">gathered in a hospice for wayfarers, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2 ParaOverride-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">a </span>hospice<span xml:lang="en-GB"> that is filled and emptied each day.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">It can also be said that </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">his subjects are now gathered in a <br /></span><span class="Koyu" xml:lang="en-GB">testing-ground</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> for the sake of manoeuvres, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and this ground also changes each hour.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Again, we may say that all his subjects </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">stay in an </span><span class="Koyu">exhibition-hall</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> for a few minutes </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">But the exhibition itself changes each moment.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Whoever leaves does not return, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and whoever comes is destined to go.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Now this situation and circumstance </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">conclusively shows that beyond the hospice, the testing-ground, the exhibition, </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">there are permanent </span><span class="CharOverride-10" xml:lang="en-GB">palaces</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">, lasting </span><span class="CharOverride-3" xml:lang="en-GB">abodes</span><span xml:lang="en-GB">, and </span><span class="CharOverride-10" xml:lang="en-GB">gardens</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> and </span><span class="Kırmızı" xml:lang="en-GB">treasuries</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> full of </span></p>

			<p class="Alt-Başlık"><span class="CharOverride-9">Seventh Aspect</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Come, let us walk a little, and see what is to be found among these </span><span class="Kırmızı">civilized</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> people.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">See, in every place, at every corner, <br />photographers are </span><span xml:lang="en-GB">sitting</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> and taking pictures.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">Look, everywhere there are </span><span class="Mavi" xml:lang="en-GB">scribes</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> sitting </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and writing things down.</span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">We will speak with the chiefs </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-2"><span xml:lang="en-GB">and looking at their </span><span class="CharOverride-4" xml:lang="en-GB">equipment</span><span xml:lang="en-GB"> </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">We cannot look at everyone and his equipment. But by way of example, </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraf-1"><span xml:lang="en-GB">It says on his card: </span></p>

It is further impossible that the Powerful and Merciful Master of the World should not accept his prayers, having not remained indifferent to them.

The very spirit of the worship of the Prophet is indeed none other than this prayer.  Again, all the motions and workings of the cosmos are in their essence prayer.

					<p class="sou_h-şiye" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="CharOverride-6"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="Onuncu_Söz_son.xhtml#footnote-078-backlink">20</a></span> There are <span class="Kırmızı">numerous</span> purposes for the existence of everything, and numerous results flow from its being. These are not <span class="Mavi">restricted</span> to this world and to the souls of men, as the people of misguidance imagine, being thus lost in vanity and purposelessness. On the contrary, the purposes for the existence and the results of the being of all things relate to the following three categories. The first and the most exalted pertains to the Creator. It consists of presenting to the gaze of the Pre-Eternal Witness the bejewelled and miraculous wonders He has affixed to the object in question, as if in a military parade. To live for <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">a fleeting second</span> is enough to attain that glance. Indeed, the potentiality and intent for existence is enough, without ever emerging into life. This purpose is <span class="Kırmızı">fully</span> realized, for example, by delicate creatures that vanish swiftly and by seeds and kernels, each a work of art, that never come to life, that is, never bear fruit or flower. They all remain untouched by <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">vanity</span> and purposelessness. Thus the first purpose of all things is to proclaim, by means of their life and existence, the miracles of power and the traces of artistry of the Maker and display them to the gaze of the Glorious Monarch. The second purpose of all existence and the result of all being pertains to <span class="Mavi">conscious creation</span>. Everything is like a truth-displaying missive, an artistic poem, or a wise word of the Glorious Maker, offered to the gaze of angels and jinn, of men and animals, and desiring to be read by them. It is an object for the contemplation and instruction of every conscious being that looks upon it. The third purpose of all existence and <img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/2.png" alt="" />result of all being pertains to the soul of the thing itself, and consists of such minor consequences as the experience of pleasure and joy, and living with some degree of permanence and comfort. If we consider the purpose of a servant employed as a <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">steersman</span> on some royal ship, we see that only one hundredth of that purpose relates to the steersman himself - i.e., the wage he receives; ninty-nine hundredths of the purpose relate to the king who owns the ship. A similar relation exists between the purpose of a thing related to its own self and its worldly existence, and its purpose related to its Maker. In the light of this <span class="Mavi">multiplicity of purposes</span> we can now explain the ultimate compatibility between divine wisdom and economy on the one hand, and divine liberality and generosity - in fact, infinite generosity - on the other hand, even though they appear to be opposites and contradictory. In the individual purposes of things, liberality and generosity predominate, and the Name of Most Generous is manifested. From the point of view of individual purpose, fruits and grains are indeed <span class="Kırmızı">beyond computation</span>, and they demonstrate infinite generosity. But in universal purposes, wisdom predominates, and the name of All-Wise is manifested. However many purposes a tree has, each of its fruits contains that many purposes, and these can be <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">divided into</span> the three categories we have established. Their universal purposes demonstrate an infinite wisdom and economy. Infinite wisdom and infinite generosity and liberality are thus combined, despite their apparent opposition. For example, one of the purposes for raising an army is the <span class="Yatık">maintenance of order</span>. <img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/2.png" alt="" /><br />Whatever troops are available for the purpose will suffice or be more than enough. But the whole army will be barely enough for other purposes such as protecting the national frontiers and repelling enemies; its size will be in perfect balance with utter wisdom. Thus the wisdom of the state will be joined to its splendour, and it can be said that there is no excess in the army.</p>

Similarly, time from the present until resurrection, Paradise and eternity, consists entirely of contingencies. The past consists of occurrences, the future of <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">contingencies</span>. Now if these two <span class="Yatık">chain</span>s of time be compared with each other, it will be seen to be true of a certainty that the Being That created yesterday and brought into being the creatures peculiar to it, is capable, too, of creating tomorrow together with its creatures. Again, there is no doubt that the beings and wonders of past time, that <span class="Mavi">wondrous display</span>, are the miraculous works of a Powerful and Glorious One. They bear decisive witness that that Powerful One is capable of creating all of the future and its contingencies, and manifesting all of its wonders. The one who creates an apple must of a certainty be able to create all the apples in the world and to bring the vast spring into being. <img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
					<p class="sou_h-şiye" xml:lang="en-GB">Conversely, the one who cannot create a spring cannot create a single apple either, for the apple is made at the same <span class="Kırmızı">workbench</span>. But the one who makes an apple can make the spring. Each apple is an example in miniature of a tree, even of a garden or a cosmos. The apple seed that carries within itself the life-story of the huge tree is, from the point of view of artistry, such a miracle that the one who creates it thus is <span class="Mavi">incapable</span> of nothing. So too, the one that creates today is able also to create the day of resurrection, and it is only the one capable of creating the spring that is able, too, to create resurrection. The one who affixes all the worlds of past time to the ribbon of time and displays them there in utmost wisdom and order, is without doubt capable of attaching other beings to the ribbon of the future and displaying them there. In several of the Words, particularly the Twenty-Second Word, we proved with <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">utter certainty</span> that: “the one who cannot create everything cannot create anything, and the one who can fashion one thing, can fashion everything. Also, if the creation of everything is entrusted to a single being, the creation of all things becomes as easy as the creation of a single thing; thus facility arises. If, on the contrary, it is <span class="Mavi">entrusted</span> to numerous causes, and ascribed to multiplicity, the creation of a single thing becomes as difficult as the creation of everything, and such difficulty arises as borders on impossibility.”</p>

If, for example, someone should say, “there exists somewhere on this earth a wondrous garden containing canned milk,” and someone else should say, “there is not,” the affirmer need only point to the place of that garden or show some of its fruits in order to prove his claim. The <span class="Mavi">denier,</span> by contrast, will have to inspect and display the whole world in order to justify his negation. So too the testimony of two <span class="Koyu" xml:lang="tr-TR">veracious witnesses</span> will be enough to establish the existence of Paradise, quite apart from the hundreds of thousands of traces, fruits and indications demonstrated by those who assert its existence. Those who deny it must examine, explore and sift the infinite cosmos and infinite time before they can prove their denial and demonstrate the non-existence of Paradise. So, o aged brothers of mine, understand how firm is belief in the hereafter.</p>
